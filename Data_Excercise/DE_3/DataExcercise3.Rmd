# Descriptives
This is the data that tells us how many groups each participant made and the language background of that participant. This is the data w need for that first box plot. 

```{r}
#desc %>%
 # distinct(Code, group_name)
```

```{r}
desc %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = no_categories)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1,
                 color = "white")
  


```
